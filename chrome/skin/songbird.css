nightingale WINDOW STYLES

All nightingale specific XUL windows directly import 
chrome://songbird/skin/nightingale.css.   For example, the
Track Editor window will import this file, but the
Add-on Manager will not (since it is shared with Firefox).

This file is the only way to add styles to nightingale when
the nightingale global skin is not the active provider for
the chrome://global/skin package.  If you want make a Feather 
that works with the default platform global skin (Winstrip 
or Pinstripe), you must import your additional styles here.
